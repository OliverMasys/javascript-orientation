<p> Hello my name is Oliver Noria, am taking the class for my degree Plan and to know more on Web. I love to game with
    firends, be out in the garden and take care of my cats. I also start to enjoy reading more and running at my local
    park. I hope to learn more on making websites and using Git. There so much to know.
